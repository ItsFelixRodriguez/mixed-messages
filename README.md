# Mixed-Messages
Codecademy Portfolio Project 

## What is this?
This project deploys my skills in Javascript, command line, and git to generate a series of random messages to output when a user runs the script. 

### Goals/To-Do
+ The Project currently works in Node. 
+ It returns a random Sign, Luck Level, and Piece of Advice. 

### Not Stricly Necessary but would be nice to add. 
+ Write an HTML page to display the result.
+ Style the page using CSS.
+ Create an onClick button to initialize the function.
